Hello, I'm Alex Dai, currently a Senior at UMD, expecting to be a graduate of University of Maryland, College Park during Spring of 2024.

I will have earned a Bachelor's Degree with a Major of Computer Science and a Minor of Mathematics.
My major studies in college focus on, in majority, Data Science related disciplines. I opted for a minor in Mathematics to further increase my knowledge of practical use cases of Linear Algebra in Data Science related fields.

Aside from Data Science related studies, I'm a hobbyist in database curation, automated frontend generation, and datamining.
In the past four years, I've attended internships at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and contributed to a project relating to identity security.

Please reach out to me at jalexdai54202@gmail.com for any job-related oppurtunities.
